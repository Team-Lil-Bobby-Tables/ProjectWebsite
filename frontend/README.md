# Senior Project - Team Website

This is the frontend for our senior project team website;

This will be attempt to use many of the libraries that the production website uses however
there will be some differences...

For example the production project uses this for styling, however this is deprecated and we should look at removing this!!!
//import { makeStyles } from "@mui/styles";

Thanks for attending my ted talk, and as a reward:
